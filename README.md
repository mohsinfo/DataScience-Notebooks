# Arrhythmia Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
This project focuses on detecting arrhythmia using machine learning techniques. Arrhythmia is an irregular heartbeat condition that can have serious health implications. The goal of this project is to build a predictive model that can classify whether a patient has an arrhythmic condition based on physiological measurements.

## Dataset
- The dataset contains various electrocardiogram (ECG) and physiological attributes collected from patients.
- It includes multiple features such as heart rate, QRS duration, PR interval, and other cardiological measurements.
- The dataset is labeled, allowing for supervised learning-based classification.
- Source: [Add dataset source if available]

## Project Structure
- `Arrhythmia Data.ipynb` – Main Jupyter Notebook containing data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `README.md` – Project documentation.

## Implementation Steps
### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handling missing values by imputing or removing incomplete records.
- Normalizing numerical features for better model performance.
- Encoding categorical variables (if applicable).

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualizing distributions of key features using histograms and boxplots.
- Identifying correlations between features using heatmaps.
- Understanding data imbalances and possible biases.

### 3. Model Training
- Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.
- Training various machine learning models:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Decision Trees
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Neural Networks (if applicable)
- Hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluating model performance using:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - ROC-AUC Curve for classification models
- Comparing models and selecting the best-performing one.

## How to Use
### Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn jupyter
```

### Running the Notebook
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/arrhythmia-detection.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd arrhythmia-detection
   ```
3. Open Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
4. Run `Arrhythmia Data.ipynb` step by step to reproduce the results.

## Results & Findings
- The model with the best performance achieved an accuracy of **[Add accuracy]**.
- Key patterns identified in the data:
  - [Add insights from EDA]
  - [Mention any challenges faced, e.g., class imbalance]
- Visualizations such as confusion matrices and ROC curves illustrate model effectiveness.

## Future Improvements
